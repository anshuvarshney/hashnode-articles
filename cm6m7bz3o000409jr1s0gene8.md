Docker has revolutionized the way we develop,ship and run applications by providing lightweight, portable and scalable containerization technology. Now a days understanding docker commands can greatly enhance your efficiency in managing containerized application.

This Guide helps in understanding the essential docker commands.

### Install docker through [docker official site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

```plaintext
docker ps -a
```

### Run a container

To start a container using a specific image:

```plaintext
docker run hello-world
```

### Stop a container

To stop a running container:

```plaintext
docker stop <container-id>
```

### Start a container

To restart a stopped container:

```plaintext
docker start <container-id>
```

### Remove a container

To delete a stopped container:

```plaintext
docker rm <container-id>
```

#you can only remove a stopped a container.

### Inspect a container

To retrieve detailed information about a container:

```plaintext
docker inspect <container-id>
```

### Check logs of a container

To view logs from a container:

```plaintext
docker log <container-id>
```

### Rename a container

To rename an existing container:

```plaintext
docker rename <container-id> <new-name>
```

### Restart a container

To restart a running or stopped container:

```plaintext
docker restart <container-id>
```

### Run a container in background

To run a container in detached mode:

```plaintext
docker run -d <container-id>
```

### Run a container in foreground

To start a container and keep it attached to the terminal:

```plaintext
docker start -a <container-id>
```

### Start a shell inside a running container

To get interactive access to a container:

```plaintext
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
```

### Download an image from the docker registry

To pull an image from the Docker registry:

```plaintext
docker pull <image:tag>
```

### Delete an image

To remove an image from your system:

```plaintext
docker rmi <images>
```

### Build a docker image through Dockerfile

To create a new image using a Dockerfile:

```plaintext
docker build <image-name:tag> .
```

### Show stats of running containers

To monitor resource usage of containers:

```plaintext
docker stats
```

### Mapping ports

To map ports between the host and the container:

```plaintext
docker run -P <image_id>
```

### Kill a running container

To forcefully stop a container:

```plaintext
docker kill <container-id>
```

### Pause a running container

To temporarily suspend a containerâ€™s processes:

```plaintext
docker pause <container-id>
```

### Unpause a running container

To resume a paused container:

```plaintext
docker pause <container-id>
```

### Prune unused docker images

To delete unused images:

```plaintext
docker image prune
```

### Prune unused docker container

To delete stopped containers:

```plaintext
docker container prune
```

### History of a docker image

To check the history of an image:

```plaintext
docker history <image-id>
```

### Login to docker hub through CLI

To authenticate with Docker Hub:

```plaintext
docker login -u <username>
```

### Tag a docker image

To tag an image with a new repository and tag:

```

### Push a image to docker registry

To push an image to Docker Hub:

```plaintext
docker push my-username/my-image
```
